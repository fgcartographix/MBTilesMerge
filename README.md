MBTilesMerge
============

Windows GUI application to merge MBTiles databases. For use in shops with restricted console access.

Some shops, especially in government, are beginning to restrict access to the Windows command-line due to perceived security threats, making the use of mbutil and related tools more difficult. This application was developed to mitigate such restrictions.
